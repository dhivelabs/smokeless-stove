Welcome to this open source project
This repository has specific structure inspired in the open hardware repository project structure guidelines. It has been also provided and organized by dHive, a community led network of social innovation labs, to bring autonomous hardware development in underprivileged communities, where children and young adults are enabled to design and develop technologies for their own communities. The repos are aimed at improving their products and sharing the design for the public domain.
